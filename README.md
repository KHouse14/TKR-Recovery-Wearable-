# TKR-Recovery-Wearable-
Prototype electronic knee sleeve that helps people recovering from Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery increase their recovery time. Typical healing time from TKR is about 4-6 months but that timeframe could be accelerated with more metrics on the knee's current health and taking steps to keep these metrics within ideal ranges. Currently, the knee sleeve measures Range of Motion and Compression Forces on the knee in real-time and then serves these data for viewing on a website.
Future prototypes will incorporate more advanced metrics, such as Mediolateral Sway on the knee, and improve the overall analysis of the data.
